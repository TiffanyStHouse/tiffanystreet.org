	<p id="left"> <font size="6"> "This song was written for the <i>Hosti·pets</i> art show put together by Ulrich Baer. When I was told the show would be on the "erotics of hospitality" I eventually landed on doing a song about the ways people (caregivers, landlords, employees, etc.) can wield knowledge and resources over those (employees, dependants, migrants, etc.) they are ostensibly helping in order to coerce them into certain behaviors."

<b>lyrics</b>
<br> <br> <br>
In this mean world of ours there is for you to learn <br>
the way to behave and to speak what to think. <br>
I give to you this and ask for in return <br>
if not love then respect your allegiance is earned. <br>
<br> <br>
There's no space here for one sworn to defy. <br>
The little ways they find to resist and to slink. <br>
And no one else will show you under the sky <br>
but you are as always free to go. <br>
<br> <br>
Out in the dark. <br>
There in the snow. <br>
Stand in the park. <br>
hours are slow. <br>
All of the key <br>
things I should know <br>
couldn't be found in your hospitality. <br>
<br> <br>
I slave away the hours so you can succeed. <br>
My knowledge of the past I gift you to sift. <br>
You turn away and wail of the things that you need <br>
none of which could be more than a sure sign of greed. <br>
Go find something productive to do around here boy. <br>
You're set to be my better when your time is through. <br>
But should you find the wait of your duty severe you will know <br>
that you are free to go. <br>
<br> <br>
Far far away. <br>
Wild on the road. <br>
But if you stray <br>
it could be cold. <br>
The will to part <br>
Amicably. <br>
Couldn't be found in your hospitality. <br>
<br> <br>
So glad to find this is where you hope to make home <br>
The land where people can learn to take. Make or break. <br>
But this is not the thing that you saw or where shown <br>
in the time long before you decided to roam. <br>
Still you should find it easy to bear what I give. <br>
The ones who don't will tell their mistake oe'r the lake. <br>
So should you try to improve this space where you live <br>
you will know that you are free to go <br>
